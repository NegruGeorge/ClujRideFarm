# ClujRideFarm
==============
I made this project when I learned how blockchain dev works ( how to work with solidity, truffle, web3 and metamask) 

This is a site where you can stake LEU token and if you wait enaugh you will be rewarded CBK tokens ('CBikeToken a token that allow you to take free bike rides in Cluj-Napoca )
